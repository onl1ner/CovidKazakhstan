# CovidKazakhstan ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡¿
**CovidKazakhstan is the application that allows you track COVID-19 cases in Kazakhstan.**

#  Where does the data come from?
To get numbers about **total infected people, amount of cured and deaths** application scraps data from the official [Ministry of Health of Kazakhstan website related to coronavirus situation](https://coronavirus2020.kz). The information about amount of **people on quarantine, home quarantine and total amount of performed tests for COVID-19** comes from API. I found the request URLs in source of https://anti-corona.kz/#data.

App uses **["Kanna"](https://github.com/tid-kijyun/Kanna)** to parse downloaded HTML
